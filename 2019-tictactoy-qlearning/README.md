Tic Tac Toe - Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)
=================================================

This is a simple project that aplies q-learning technique in order
to implement an 'inteligent' agent to play this game.

Thanks to Fernando Tenorio, who helped me understand the concepts of q-learning and also helped me identify and fix some implementation bugs. His Github page is: https://github.com/fernandotenorio
